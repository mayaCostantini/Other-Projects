/*! \mainpage Digital Analysis of Fingerprints - Group D - MSIAM 2019/2020
 *   This project was realized by the MSIAM 2019/2020 - Group D composed of Gr√©goire Lambert, Maya Costantini, Roman Edward Zacharek, Matthias Lotta and Diana Farhat
 * during the January modelling project.
 * 
 *  The main goal of the project was to reproduce artifacts that would appear on data corresponding to fingerprints. These modifications 
 *  can be of various sorts. For instance we implemented rotations, symmetries, translations, approximations of dry and moist
 *  , of an effect of weak pressure and more ! We used openCV 4.2 for image manipulation.
 *  
 * This project was also a lot about managing a group of 5 during a month in C++.
 * 
 * You will find on this repository : 
 * 
 * README.md : It contains a lot of informations on how to setup your computer for the project.
 * 
 * test: contains the test files (which are more like demo files) of each subpart that we implemented. 
 * 
 * src: source code, definition of our functions.
 * 
 * include: headers
 * 
 * documentation: config files for building the documentation
 * 
 * data: is separated in two subfolders (mainly). 'original' contains the original data on which we worked. You need to import it from somewhere else. 'result' will contain the output data.
 * 
 * msiam_m1_project.pdf : contains the original subject for this project.
